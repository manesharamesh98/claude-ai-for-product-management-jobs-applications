Analyse the job description and resume in the `/Users/manesharamesh/Desktop/Job Applications/your-job-application-files` folder.

Read all files in the folder. Identify the job description file and the resume file (PDF or text).

Then produce a structured report with the following three sections:

## 1. Key Phrases & Keywords from the Job Description

- Extract the most important keywords, phrases, and skills from the job description.
- Group them into categories: **Technical Skills**, **Soft Skills**, **Domain Knowledge**, **Tools & Methodologies**, and **Other Requirements**.
- Highlight any phrases that appear repeatedly or are emphasised — these are likely screening criteria.

## 2. Most Relevant Experiences in Your Resume

- For each key phrase or requirement identified in Section 1, find the most relevant experience, bullet point, or skill from the resume that maps to it.
- Present this as a table with three columns: **Job Requirement** | **Your Matching Experience** | **Strength of Match** (Strong / Moderate / Weak / Gap).
- After the table, summarise your top 5 strongest selling points for this specific role.

## 3. Resume Recommendations

Based on the gaps and moderate matches identified above, provide specific and actionable recommendations:
- **Reframe**: Suggest how to reword existing bullet points to better align with the job description's language and priorities.
- **Add**: Suggest any experiences, projects, or skills from the resume that are currently undersold or missing and should be highlighted.
- **Remove or De-emphasise**: Flag anything in the resume that is not relevant to this role and could be replaced with more targeted content.
- **Keywords to Incorporate**: List specific words or phrases from the job description that should appear in the resume to pass ATS screening.

For each recommendation, provide a **before** (current wording) and **after** (suggested wording) where applicable.


Writing style:
- Be specific and actionable — avoid vague advice like "tailor your resume."
- Reference exact bullet points from the resume and exact phrases from the job description.
- Format the output clearly with markdown headers, bullet points, and tables.
- Be concise and direct.
