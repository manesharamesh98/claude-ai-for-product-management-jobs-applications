Read all files in the `/Users/manesharamesh/Desktop/Job Applications/your-job-application-files` folder. Identify the resume, the job description, and the cover letter (if one exists).

Then produce a structured rating report as follows:

---

## 1. Resume Rating

Rate each section of the resume on two dimensions using a score out of 10:
- **Relevance to Job Description**: How well does this section align with what the job is asking for?
- **ATS Friendliness**: How well is this section formatted and worded for Applicant Tracking Systems?

Evaluate the following sections (or whichever are present in the resume):

| Resume Section | Relevance to JD (/10) | ATS Friendliness (/10) | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
| Profile / Summary | | | |
| Education | | | |
| Each Work Experience entry (rate separately) | | | |
| Projects | | | |
| Skills | | | |

For each section, provide:
- **What's working well**: Specific strengths in that section.
- **What needs improvement**: Specific weaknesses or missed opportunities.
- **ATS flags**: Any formatting issues, missing keywords, or structural problems that could cause ATS rejection (e.g., tables, images, unusual headers, missing standard keywords).

### Overall Resume Score
Provide an overall weighted score out of 100, with the following weights:
- Profile/Summary: 20%
- Work Experience: 40%
- Skills: 15%
- Education: 10%
- Projects: 15%

## 2. Cover Letter Rating (if provided)

If a cover letter is found, rate it on the following criteria, each out of 10:

| Criteria | Score (/10) | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| Opening hook — does it grab attention? | | |
| Alignment to job description — does it address key requirements? | | |
| Use of specific examples and metrics | | |
| Demonstration of company knowledge | | |
| Tone and professionalism | | |
| Call to action / closing strength | | |
| ATS keyword coverage | | |

For each criterion, provide a brief explanation of the score.

### Overall Cover Letter Score
Provide an overall score out of 100.

## 3. Top 5 Improvements

List the 5 highest-impact changes the applicant should make across the resume and cover letter (if present) to improve their chances for this specific role. Rank them by impact. For each, provide:
- **What to change**
- **Why it matters for this role**
- **Suggested fix** (with specific wording where possible)

---

## 4. Keyword Gap Analysis

Create a table listing important keywords and phrases from the job description and whether they appear in the resume and cover letter:

| Keyword / Phrase | In Resume? | In Cover Letter? | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| | Yes/No | Yes/No/N/A | |

---

Writing style:
- Be honest and critical — the goal is to improve, not to flatter.
- Reference exact wording from the resume, cover letter, and job description.
- Format the output clearly with markdown headers, tables, and bullet points.
- Be concise and direct.
